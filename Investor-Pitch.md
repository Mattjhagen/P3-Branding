What Is VibeCodes?

VibeCodes is a SaaS platform that builds accessible AI tools at the intersection of fintech, voice AI, and blockchain. Our mission is to democratize financial tools and shield users from digital exploitation—scams, fraud, and broken systems.

 What Is P3 Investors?

P3 Investors is our first core product—a no-code Web3 lending platform that lets everyday investors:
Launch decentralized micro-loan funds using smart contracts. Leveraging CoinGecko API for insights and training of AI agent in non biased current events in correlation with historical Blockchain data.
Track ROI and borrower reputation on-chain.
Pool funds with peers or run solo portfolios
(Soon) Plug in AI agents for borrower screening and compliance


The Tech Stack:

React / Next.js frontend
Node.js + Express backend with REST + GraphQL APIs
OpenAI + custom NLP for risk scoring & smart contract generation
Polygon & Base blockchains for low-fee smart contracts
API from CoinGecko for market research and DeepSeek to train our LLM
Fully containerized for Netlify + Cloudflare edge deployment

Market Opportunity

Peer-to-peer lending platforms processed $64B+ globally in 2023
Web3 lending protocols like Aave, Compound, etc. account for $5B+ TVL
There’s no “Squarespace for DeFi Lending” yet—until now

Business Model:

Investors and potential borrowers would use our proprietory reputation score to receive or lend secure micro-loans. The platforms reputation score differs from the traditional credit scoring model enabling anyone regardless of past credit history or social status to have a chance to prove themselves as a valued investor/borrower.

One of the biggest struggles start ups have is receiving the capital needed to allow their SaaS to grow leaving many dreams unfunded. As traditional banks are no longer taking risks and only looking at profit in this capitalistic landscape we are unfortunately in. 

As every investor and start up knows with out risk - there's no reward.

Why we are Different: 

We take a portion from the interest payed into the platform to fund an insurance pool. As we initially launch reputation will only be built by accessing a secure loan which will only be available after loan payment and interest + platform fees are payed in full. 

This platform will still be significantly cheaper than traditional banking interest and funds can be transferred via the Blockchain network globally with very little cost (pending KYC compliance).

What We’re Looking For:

Pre-seed check ($25k–$100k) to finish compliance features and scale acquisition
Angels who vibe with ethical AI, neurodivergent founders, and mission-driven fintech
Strategic intros to crypto compliance partners, KYC vendors, and fintech devs

Architecture for Blockchain AI agent available upon request (serious inquiries only)

Why Now?

The future of finance is trustless, decentralized, and AI-assisted. We’re building tools that give people power without predation. If that resonates with you—let’s talk.
